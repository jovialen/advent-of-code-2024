# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 🎄

## Let's get those stars 🌟🌟🌟

It's that time of the year once again! And once again I'm attempting the [✨ Advent of Code ✨](https://adventofcode.com/2024)! Here are my solutions for this years problems.

## 💬 Language?

Whatever I feel like, any given day, any given problem! Santa doesn't discriminate and neither do I!

## 🏅 Quality?

Probably not good! I'm solving these problems as fast as I can, and I submit what worked. So probably a lot of slow and ugly solutions! My favourite!

## 📜 Point of this README?

No point at all! I'm not gonna read this again, you probably don't exist and I don't think God would touch this repo with a ten-foot stick. Still, if you do exist, here it is!
